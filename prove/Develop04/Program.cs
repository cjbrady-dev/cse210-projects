// Have a menu system to allow the user to choose an activity.
// Each activity should start with a common starting message that provides the name of the activity, a description, and asks for and sets the duration of the activity in seconds. Then, it should tell the user to prepare to begin and pause for several seconds.
// Each activity should end with a common ending message that tells the user they have done a good job, and pause and then tell them the activity they have completed and the length of time and pauses for several seconds before finishing.

// The interface for the program should remain generally true to the one shown in the video demo.
// Provide activities for reflection, breathing, and enumeration, as described below:
